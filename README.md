This is the final state, but I will keep working on this game, because I think it has potential. I am going to finish what was supposed to be an arcade style physics based shooter, with a few levels and stuff.

Unfortunately I had a massive project scope that I never really managed to recover from so I definitely am going to do terribly in the actual jam lol
